# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Portfolio Site


This is the third draft of my developer portfolio. The sole difference from the second draft is that I have included a link to the second group project. There is an "about me" section that gives a brief summary of my background, a work section that provided images that link to previously written applications, and a brief contact section.
