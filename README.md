# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Portfolio Site


This is the second draft of my developer portfolio. The sole difference from the first draft is that I have included a link to the first group project. There is an "about me" section that gives a brief summary of my background, a work section that provided images that link to previously written applications, and a brief contact section.
